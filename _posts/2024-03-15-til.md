title: "[Tech] Today I learned"
---

Today is my birthday, on this occasion, let me share something I have learned over the last few weeks. I did a bit of problem solving these days. Learned some thing new
### Fast compute and of a range
Problem statement: Given an array, you have `Q` queries, each query gives you `l` and `r`. You want smartly compute `a[l] & a[l + 1] & .. & a[r]`.

Called init[i][j] = 1 if the j-th bit of i-th number is turned on. For every column of init. Compute the prefix sum of this column. Now for each query `l` and `r`. Consider the i-th bit, the prefix sum size n of column i as `b`, if the there are r - l + 1 number of 1's between l and r. Add `2 ^ i` to the answer.

### Fast sum of a constant with every number of an array
Problem statement: Given an array, you have `Q` queries, each query gives you a number `c`. You want to smartly compute `a[0] & c + a[1] & c + .. + a[n - 1] & c`

Call `count[i]` as the number of turned on bit of every number in `a`. For every turned on `i-th` bit in `a`. Add `count[i] * 2 ^ i` to the answer.


### Shortest path modelling

### Segment tree
I finally now understand and can implement basic segment tree problems.
