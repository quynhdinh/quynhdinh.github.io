Who is the smartest person that you personally know?

I like to define a smart person as a person who excels at many subjects.

I know a guy who one year ahead of me who is absolutely incredible. I happened to know him for a long time because our mothers are friends.

He was a Chemistry major at high school and actually won third prize nationwide. As a result, he was directly admitted to any university he wanted to. Even so, he scored the entrance exam with very high score! At college, he majored in Computer Science with honors and won some Algorithmic prizes. He is a problem setter for a Physics contest at college, so he must know how to solve those non trivial Physics problems. He was a president of a type of Math club at college. He scored 8.0 in IELTS two times. He graduated valedictorian in his class. He is interested in doing research and had papers in AI field. He is now doing his Ph.D in AI in the United States.

This is actually a short version of what he has accomplished. I am excited to see what he will accomplish next!
