title: "Why you shouldn't lie"
---

I just speed run through Lying by Sam Harris. The book is suprisingly short(100+ pages) but very powerful.

Harris started with a very powerful quote: "We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy" and says "Lying is the
royal road to chaos."

The book essentially contains 3 parts. First, Harris discusses about lying and his thoughts then he includes an interview of him about the wrongess of lying with his former Stanford professor who taught Harris's life changing ethical course.

I am now myself very concious that I don't want to tell lies to anybody. It just makes me feel bad to myself and unhappy.

It is just hard to convince you that you shouldn't lie in just a few hundred words blog post. You will have countless of example of no harm lies like telling your kid Santa Clause is real or concealing somebody cancer to himself but I believe you will doubts clear after reading the book.

The books made a very big impression on me and I recommend you to read it too.
