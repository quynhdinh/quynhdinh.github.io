title: "On thinking long term"
---
I have been recently learned that there is a huge clock that is working in Houston. The clock that keep time
for 10000 years with no human intervention.
The clock is the project that funded by Jeff Bezos under a foundation named The Long Now. It is so lucky that it is done in the late 90s 
that we get to see the clock ticks one time on the year 2000.
According to Jeff Bezos, symbols are important. Humanity are now so capable that we now need to think longer term. 10000 years ago, human don't make all that much damage to the Earth as people do today(and great things too). 

The idea resonates with me well in some respects
- I believe strongly in the importance of nuturing the children since day 1. The earlier you prepare for the child, the better the child turn into years later.
- You can't take lightly on your studies. You don't ask the question: "What is this knowledge for?". You can only connect the dots looking backwards.

I believe that we all take better action if we factor in this thinking long term in every major decision in life.

I think the 10000 year clock an incredible powerful symbol that will influence people to think long term at whatever they do. I can imagine, 500 years from now 
the people of planet Earth will says something like "There is a clock that is running in this mountain for 500 years by some people in 21st century which symbolizes the idea of long term thinking."
