title: "Wisdoms from three centenarians"
---
 I watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AThycGCakk) every Chirstmas. I first watched this video somewhere 4 years ago by a recommendation on Facebook. A guy shared the video and a caption that basically goes: "If this video doesn't make you feel good this Christmas, I don't know whatelse does". I'm glad that I gave it a watch and by far it is the only video that put a smile on my face every time I watch it.
 
 The video is a interview of three 100 plus year-old people which the interviewer asking them their approach to life, regrets and advice for the youth.
 
 I love every single bit of the video. I love how these three take on their life and confront life adversities.
 
 This might be a bit late for a Christmas to-watch. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
