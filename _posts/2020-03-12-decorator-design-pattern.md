title: "[Tech] Decorator design pattern"
---
The decorator pattern
allows behaviour to e added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
provides an alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
supports the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be devided between classes with unique areas of concern.
