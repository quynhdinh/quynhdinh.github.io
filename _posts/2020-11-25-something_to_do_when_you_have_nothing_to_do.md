title: "My list of thing to do when I have nothing to do"
---
I would like to share a list of things I keep refering to when I see myself being unproductive and slowing down. Plus, having a list at hand doesn't make me have to make too many decisions in a day, which is great. There are five, which are listed in in descending order of preference. Also, this blog is entirely inspired by [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr5Iyu7U5z4). Notice that this is a list of things to do when I have nothing to do, not, not to do when you get bored since I think practically nobody ever gets bored these days.


### Exercise
This should top the list. For me, something that you should think of when you want to get your life improve in whatever aspect is to do some exercise. The benefits of exercising are just mind blowing.
### Cleaning things up
Try to get my table clutter-free, empty the trash basket make my bed, hanging up clothes.
### Planning out the future
This requires skills and you will get to do this better and it makes more sense as you do it.
### Reading
There are amazing reads out there that are needed to get read and to comtemplating them.
### Learn new skills
I like to identify myself a learner. But in fact I don't always enjoy learning.
