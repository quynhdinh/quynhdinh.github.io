title: "To bring the world-class healthcare to everyone"
---
I want to note here a vision and also a wish of mine for the future health care system. Simply put "To bring the world-class healthcare system to everyone". This motto is largely inspired by the vision of Bill Gates when he started Microsoft in 1975.

This year, I had a surgery and I have visited quite many hospitals and none of them works the way I had expected. Information Technology(IT) has permated quite a bit in hospitals but there are still unnecessary waits and many procedures that can entirely be automated.

I hope one day IT along with the advances of medical will bring the best possible health care system to everyone as how game-changing personal computers have become ubiquitous decades ago.
