title: "[Tech] Hardest interview I ever had"
---

I recently faced one of the toughest interview processes of my career, which consisted of three grueling rounds: an Online Assessment (OA), an online interview, and an onsite interview with multiple loops. Here’s how it unfolded.

### Round 1: The Online Assessment

The first round was an Online Assessment filled with two hard, one medium problems. I only had to manage to solve them in 75 minutes. The platform is Codepair which is kind of buggy in my opinion. The problem was a hard graph problem, I even solved this problem before but took the most time to write code the solution because the platform is very strange. I remember distinctly my failure attemp at the company because of this. The format of the problem is kinda strange too. The second is a medium problem where you are given N queens, you need to output the first queen index that attack another queen. 

I submitted my last problem in the last minute.
### Round 2: The Online Interview

A few days later, I received an invitation for the second round: an online interview. This round consisted of a single hard problem, and it was designed to test my problem-solving skills under pressure.
The interview came in asked about by experience for 30 minutes, we shared a code pair link. He pasted the problem statement, I understood the requirement but couldn't came up with a solution. I asked him for a hint. He said forget about the contraints. I immediately came up with a brute force DFS solution.

This back-and-forth was both exhilarating and nerve-wracking. I had to think on my feet, adapt my solutions, and demonstrate my reasoning skills. In the end, I managed to arrive at a satisfactory solution, but the experience left me feeling mentally exhausted.
### Round 3: The Onsite Interview

The final round was the onsite interview, which consisted of three loop interviews with different team members. 
Loop Interview Breakdown

Interview 1: With a engineering leader
    He came in asked me about my working experience. Then ask me about a medium problem, I cleared it out easily, he told me to optimize space a bit. I think for a moment and propose a solution. He then game me a Trie problem. I gave him some non Trie solution the ultimately came to the Trie solution. I told him I don't very confident knowing all the details but he kept saying that it was totally ok. I propose a solution but when I get to write code on the white bug, I made bug everywhere. He eye-debuged my code in seconds. We are 5 minutes overdue. He wished me good luck and left the room.

Interview 2: Technical Problem
    This is when I completely flop. An engineer came in first asked me about my expierence. Then gave me about some strategy game. I didn't have a clue. He hinted me it was divide and conquer. I still don't know how code it. I asked for another problem. He ask me to solve the "merge K sorted linked list"

Interview 3: Technical Problem
    An engineer came in introducing about him self and asking about my prior expierence. Very chill, then gave me a apparent graph problem. I struggled for the whole time. He told me to solve an easy version of the problem. I couldn't bring any solution. He hinted me and then I knew the solution for that small problem. I asked him the computer to write the code. He told me to write code in ideone.com, I managed to write the solution in just 5 minutes. He commented a bit about my code then leave. 

There was supposed to have an interview with the CTO but apparently he was busy so I didn't get to meet him.
### Conclusion
I knew that they will only asked hard level problems in the interview but I don't think that they will be that hard. The lucky part is that I have a feeling that they will asked a Trie problem so I had brushed up on my Trie knowledge before hand. The unlucky part is that they game me strategy-based problem which I never liked.

The bar of hiring is amazing. I happened to know 2 of three interviewers are IOI medalist!
