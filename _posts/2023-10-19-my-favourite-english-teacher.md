title: "My favourite English teacher"
---
[Dan Hauer](https://www.youtube.com/@DanHauer) is absolutely one of my favourite Youtuber ever. Not only do I learned from him about English but also the attitude to life and creativity. Even he stopped producing videos years ago, I can still go back and watch his videos from time to time, and every time I get to learn something new.
### English teaching videos
The amount of effort put into his videos is absolutely large. 
He illustrates grammar points or a piece of vocabulary with humor. 
Being a native himself(not to mention he holds an English degree from college), his knowledge about the language is very deep, plus, he had been teaching in Vietnam, he knows what is hard for Vietnamese students and he produced videos to do just that: 
fix legendary grammar mistakes, correct words and phrases that are unnatural.
Other than that, once in a while, he did some cultural content like Vietnamese food or the Tet. He insists high standards for his videos, if you pay enough attention when watching his English teaching videos, 
you see that he always puts creativity and hard word into every minute of his video. 
Frankly, there are many Youtubers out there who put little or zero creativity into their outputs. Dan could always do easy content and earn money but he never did that. 
He is one of the very few true content creators in Vietnam at the time.
### His life lessons 
Every single one of his video is creative and a must-watch. He stopped making videos when he thinks that he wouldn't be feel proud of his videos. And I think this is an excellent viewpoint in life. In everything I do or whatever thing I finished I often ask myself a question "Do I feel proud of that?", I often suggest my nephews and nieces to work hard in college that after spending 4 years there, you are looking back at your journey have a sense of proud from that.
I have plenty of certificates that now looking back, I don't see any value in it. 
He is ethical, rational and funny. He loves orinality and loaths plagiarism.

At one point, he started his second channel where he uploaded only non English teaching content. Those videos are great, too. I enjoy the [Internet Sabbath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4mtmPphbT0) most.
### Miscellaneous
He actually took a Lambda bootcamp and become a software engineer in his thirties! He even secured a job and is now working in the United States.
