title: "My favourite English teacher"
---
Dan Hauer is absolutely one of my favourite Youtuber ever. Not only do I learned from him about English but also the attite to life and creativity. Even he stopped producing videos years ago, I can still go back and watch his videos from time to time, and every time I get to learn something new
### English teaching videos
The amount of effort put into his videos is absolutely large.
### His life lessions 
Every single one of his video takes non trivial amount to make. He stopped making videos when he thinks that he wouldn't be feel proud of his videos. And I think this is an excellent viewpoint in life. In everything I do or whatever thing I finished I often ask myself a question "Do I feel proud of that?", I often tell my nephews to work hard in college that after spending 4 years there, you are looking back at your degree have a sense of proud in this.
### Miscellaneous
He actually took a Lambda bootcamp and become a software engineer in his thirties! He secured a job and is now working in the United States.
