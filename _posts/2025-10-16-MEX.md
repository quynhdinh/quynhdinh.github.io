title: "Problems on MEX"
---

MEX is the minimum excluded value of a set of integers. For example, MEX({0,1,2,3}) = 4, MEX({1,2,3}) = 0, MEX({0,1,3}) = 2.
De
fine MEX(A) as the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set A.

Here are some important properties of MEX:
1. `MEX(A)` can only be up to `|A|`, where `|A|` is the size of the set A.
   Why? Because if A contains all integers from 0 to `|A|-1`, then `MEX(A) = |A|`. If any integer in this range is missing, then `MEX(A)` will be less than `|A|`.
   Problems: [Leetcode 2598](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-missing-non-negative-integer-after-operations/)

Consider the problem. Given a multiset `S`. Now you need to process `Q` queries. Each query is one of the following types:
1. `+ x`: Add the integer `x` to the multiset `S`.
2. `- x`: Remove one occurrence of the integer `x` from the multiset `S`. It is guaranteed that `x` exists in `S` when this query is given.
3. `?`: Output the MEX of the multiset `S`. We want to do each of these operations in `O(log n)` time.
