title: "My experience at VNG and Zalo"
---
I started my career at VNG the first ever unicorn of Vietnam(company which is worth a billion USD). Today I want to share that experience to you.

### Fresher
I joined the fame fresher program in May/2021. To join the program, there are 2 rounds, the first round is a test that need to be done with many other students, the other round will be in VNG campus. The interview process is extremely structured. I am proud that I got in a program(I also did test in my junior year but didn't even got through first round :D)

I joined Zingplay Game Studios(yes, the `s` is at the Studios not in Game, I don't know why) which is the primary income stream of VNG. The program lasted for about 3 months and I was assigned to a team with 3 other members. There are two parts of the fresher program. First, freshers will be trained on both technical skills and soft skills. Soft skills include communication, presentation. Technical skills are about coding, clean code and how to build a game from end to end. The first part is generally not graded not counted towards your final grade. The second part is important, every team need to build a game which seems really overwhelming to me at first.

The project will be structured in 3 builds. One build will be included a set of features. After each build, it will be sent to QC engineers to get it tested and received bugs report. At the end of the program 

### Software Engineer at Zalo
I joined my full time job at Zalo in September/2021.
### In conclusion
Joining VNG definitely makes my resume look better. I had made many life long friends there.
