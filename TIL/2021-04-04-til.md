title: "TIL: longest valid parentheses"
---
Given a sequence of brackets of length `N`, you need to find the longest substring of well-formed parentheses. Constraint `N <= 30000`.

You can submit your solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/)
### Naive brute force solution
For every substring check whether it is valid. The total time cost is `O(N^3)` which is obviously does not fit the constraint.
### Dynamic programming solution
It is obvious that a valid substring must be ended with `')'`. We defined `dp(i)` as the longest valid parentheses that ends at `i`. The answer of the problem is the maximum element of dp.

If `s[i] = ')'` and `s[i - 1] = '('` then the substring is of form `.....()`, we update `dp[i] = dp[i - 2] + 2`

If `s[i] = ')'` and `s[i - 1] = ')'` then the substring is of the form `.....))` then

we check if `s[i - dp[i - 1] - 1] = '('` then 

`dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - dp[i - 1] - 2] + 2`

The reason behind this is that if the 2nd last `)` was a part of valid substring(say `sub`) for the last `)` to be a part of a larger substring, there must be a corresponding starting `(` which lies before the valid substring of which the 2nd last `)` is a part(i.e. before `sub`). Thus, if the character before `sub` happens to be `(`, we update the `dp[i]` as an addition of 2 in the length of `sub` which is `dp[i - 1]`. To this, we also add the length of the valid substring just before the term `(sub)`, i.e. `dp[i - dp[i - 1] - 2]`.

We can update our answer `answer` by `dp[i]` as we go.

Time complexity: `O(N)`

Space complexity: `O(N)`.
