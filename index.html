        <p>Thanks for stopping by, I am a person who is on the journey exploring myself. I always try to
        be open-minded. I try to learn new things and consolidate my learnings into writings. This is the platform that helps me to do just that.</p>
        <p>I share about technical I share about what I learn <a href="notes">up here</a>. Posts that are prefixed with [Tech] are technical.
        If you don't write code you might want to skip that.</p>
        <p>A bit about me, I am doing software engineering professionally, a generally positive and happy person.</p>
