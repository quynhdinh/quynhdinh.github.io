	<p class="lead">Welcome, I'm Quynh</p>
	<p></p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by, I am a person who is on the journey exploring myself. I always try to
        be open-minded. I try to learn new things and consolidate my learnings into writings. This is the platform that helps me to do just that.</p>
        <p> I share about what I learn <a href="notes">up here</a>. Posts that are prefixed with [Tech] are technical.
        If you don't write code you might want to skip that.</p>
        <p>A bit about me, I am doing software engineering professionally, a generally positive and happy person.</p>
		<p>I wrote the first line of code when I was 16 years old. I immediately realized I have a knack for computer logical thinking. 
			It was then very obvious for me to decide what I wanted to study in college. I took computer science courses in college and have been working in the field ever since. 
		I am passionate about coding and enjoy solving complex problems through programming. Up here, I shared what I learned which could be something I find important or something that takes me 
		a long time to understand.</p>
